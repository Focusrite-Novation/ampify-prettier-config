# Ampify Prettier Config

This stores the default Ampify prettier config used across it's repositories.

## Prerequisites:

- Access to the [Focusrite-Novation npm registry](https://github.com/Focusrite-Novation/ampify-web-ui#add-focusrite-novation-npm-registry)

## Updating

To bump the client version, we use [npm version](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-version/). For basic usage run:

- `npm version (patch|minor|major)` depending on the change. More options avaiable. When the change has been merged to `master`, the new version will be published.
